I am making a dentist office web site for my NSS personal project which will have the following features:

1. Responsive 
2. Online appointment request
3. Before and after photo gallery 
4. Driving direction to the facility 
5. Link for download different types of form

On the development branch all the files are uptodate (including all the features). I have some issues merging it with the master branch. I will fixd that problem, meanwhile you can check the complete website up and running on backlift.

(Note: A seperate javascript file (contact.js) created for contact page for the google map and direction) 

Future add-ons:
1. Secured login for both doctor and patient 
2. Make and update patient chart
3. Send e-mail to notify appointment
4. Patient request to release medical information
5. Find different location and make appointment request for the specific location  
6. Misc.
